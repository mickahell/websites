        Here is the online version of my <b>Quantum games</b>. Of course, all of these are free and <b>opensource</b>. <br>
        Every of these games are 100% coded by me, sometimes I've been inspired by pop-culture and something by <b>physics law</b>. <br>
        Some are part of <b>experiments</b> and others can be part of past <b>Hackaton</b> or a onenight stand idea... 
        I like created games and making then winnable by a machine. So here every of these games have a tough <b>robot as opponent !</b><br>
        Will you succeed to win each times ? Have fun and good luck !!!
